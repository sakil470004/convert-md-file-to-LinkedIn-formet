ðŸš€ **New Problem Solved: Array Pairing and Modular Arithmetic!** ðŸ¤“ðŸ’¡

I just tackled an interesting coding challenge: **"Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k"**. Here's what I learned from this problem:

ðŸ”¹ **Problem Overview:**
Given an array of integers and a value `k`, the task is to check if we can divide the array into pairs where the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`. If it's possible, return true, otherwise false.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Learnings:**
1. **Modular Arithmetic**: 
   This problem reinforced the power of remainders. By focusing on the remainder when dividing by `k`, I was able to group numbers into buckets based on their remainders. 

2. **Remainder Buckets**:
   The idea of pairing up numbers with complementary remainders (i.e., `remainder + (k - remainder) = k`) was key! For example, a number with remainder `1` must pair with a number whose remainder is `k - 1`. If these counts donâ€™t match, pairing is impossible.

3. **Edge Cases Matter**:
   Handling cases like numbers that are directly divisible by `k` (remainder 0) required special attention. These need an even count since they must be paired with themselves.

4. **Optimizing Pairing**:
   Rather than trying all combinations, counting remainders made the process efficient, reducing time complexity significantly. This approach ensures that the problem can be solved in linear time.

This problem taught me how to handle pairing in arrays using modular arithmetic and edge cases, which is a valuable approach for solving many array-based problems efficiently.

ðŸ”¢ **Example**:

Given `arr = [1,2,3,4,5,10,6,7,8,9]` and `k = 5`, the output is `true`. The pairs can be: 
- (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), and (5,10) â€” all of which are divisible by 5.

âœ¨ **Takeaway**: Modular arithmetic is a powerful tool for solving array pairing problems efficiently, and this challenge is a great demonstration of that. I'm excited to apply this pattern to more problems in the future!
